# OpenAPI Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

OpenAPI Special Interest Groups, or "SIGs", are the OpenAPI Initiative's way of focusing work in particular areas.  SIGs may start with just a Slack channel to guage interest.  SIGs with enough traction to produce work may have their own GitHub repositories and regular Zoom calls, and ultimately produce work that becomes part of, or a companion to, the OpenAPI Specification.

## Inudstry Standards

Focusing on how industry standards groups make use of OpenAPI specifications.

* [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/open-api/openapi) channel: #sig-industry-standards

## Lifecycle

A place to discuss how to represent how APIs change in time in the context of OpenAPI.

* [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/open-api/openapi) channel: #sig-lifecycle

## Moonwalk

Working group for the next major (post-3.x) version of the OpenAPI Specification

* GitHub: [OAI/sig-moonwalk](https://github.com/OAI/sig-moonwalk)
* Zoom Meetings: Tuesdays at 9AM US-Pacific

## Overlays

The Overlay specification defines a way of creating documents that contain information to be merged with an OpenAPI description at some later point in time, for the purpose of updating the OpenAPI description with additional information.

* GitHub: [OAI/Overlay-Specification](https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification)
* [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/open-api/openapi) channel: #sig-overlays

## Security

Workgroup to shape security components of the OpenAPI Specification.

* [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/open-api/openapi) channel: #sig-security

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)

Service level agreements and APIs.

* GitHub: [isa-group/SLA4OAI-TC](https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-TC)
* [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/open-api/openapi) channel: #sig-sla

## Travel

An OpenAPI Initiative workgroup to address industry specific connective/API concerns of the travel industry.

* [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/open-api/openapi) channel: #sig-travel

## Workflows

The OpenAPI Specification provides a way to document individual API calls and how to use them, but it doesn't give insight into the common ways to sequence those operations. While all APIs can benefit from formally describing these workflows, this is particularly important when considering more complex or more secure APIs. 

The OpenAPI Workflows Special Interest Group was created to address this common problem. The goal is to construct a formal way to describe these sequences and support documentation of flows, such as a multi-part OAuth flow with JSON signing and refresh token behavior.
